title: About Rails Coder

<p>Hi I'm Tors. I've been hacking code and building websites since 2008. I started out as a front-end developer dabbling in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Eventually I made my way through the backend side of developing web applications. I still go back and forth from front to back of the stack from time to time. <a href='http://ruby-lang.org'>Ruby</a> is my primary programming language of choice and I use Ruby on Rails as my web framework. Recently, I've also been learning a bunch of other stuff like <a href='http://nodejs.org'>node</a> and <a href='http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/'>coffeescript</a>. I'm very passionate about my craft and I strive to be better everyday. </p>
<p>
  
I'm currently working for <a href='http://www.binaries.sg'>Binaries Group Pte Ltd</a> in Singapore.  </p>

<p>If you want to get in touch, you can reach me at tors @ railscoder.com</p>
