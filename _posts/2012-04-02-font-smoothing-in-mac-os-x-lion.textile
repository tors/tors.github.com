I spend most of my time on the Terminal. I'm using an external monitor and once in a while, when I open the Terminal from a cold reboot, I'd lose the font aliasing that I've set. I've never really bothered to solve this maybe because it only happens very rarely. I'm using a ViewSonic display by the way. Anyway, I'll just leave the command here so I don't have to google for it and hopefully it would help others as well.

{% highlight sh %}
defaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 2
{% endhighlight %}

Here are the list values that you can set for font smoothing:

* 1 - Light Smoothing
* 2 - Medium Smoothing (which I'm currently using)
* 3 - Strong Smoothing

You need to restart your Terminal, Vim, or other apps to be able to see the effect.
