Most Rails plugins and gems are now Rails 3. When updating to Rails 3 isn't an option, what you do is you use older version of the plugin. I'll be using "ryanb's":http://www.railscasts.com. Here's how you do it.

{% highlight sh %}
script/plugin install git://github.com/ryanb/cancan.git -r 2.0
{% endhighlight %}

If you are using bundler, it's very straightforward.

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'cancan', :git => "http://github.com/ryan/cancan.git", :branch => "2.0"
{% endhighlight %}
